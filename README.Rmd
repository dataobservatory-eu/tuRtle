The goal of tuRtle is to parse or export R data with the Turtle syntax for the Resource Description Framework (RDF). This is a very early version that is being co-developed with the [dataset](https://dataset.dataobservatory.eu/) package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of tuRtle with `remotes::install_github()`:

```{r installation, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("dataobservatory-eu/tuRtle", build = FALSE)
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(tuRtle)
testtdf <- data.frame (s = c("eg:o1", "eg:01", "eg:02"),
                       p = c("a", "eg-var:", "eg-var"),
                       o = c("qb:Observation",
                             "\"1\"^^<xs:decimal>",
                             "\"2\"^^<xs:decimal>"))

examplefile <- file.path(tempdir(), "ttl_dataset_write.ttl")
ttl_write(tdf=testtdf, file_path = examplefile)
readLines(examplefile)
```
